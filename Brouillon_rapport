Introduction
1.1 Project Overview
PuissanceX is a modern implementation of the classic Connect-4 game, developed as part of an academic project (SAE) focusing on software development and artificial intelligence. The game is built using the Boardifier framework, providing a robust and extensible console interface.
Project Context and Requirements
The project was developed as part of the SAE (Situated Application Exercise) curriculum, with specific requirements:
Implementation of a console-based Connect-4 game
Development of at least two different AI strategies
Creation of a technical report documenting the implementation
Testing through various input files
Future extension to JavaFX GUI implementation
Project Structure
The project follows a well-defined MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture:
Model: Manages game logic and state
View: Handles display of game elements
Controller: Coordinates interactions between main.model and main.view
Game Objectives
PuissanceX implements the classic Connect-4 rules:
Two players compete on a 6x7 grid
Players alternately place their disks in columns
First player to align 4 disks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins
Game is declared a draw if the grid is filled without a winner
